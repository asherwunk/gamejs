# THIS IS A FORK

This is my own personal fork of the amazing gamejs library: https://gamejs.org . I have modified it slightly for use in my own asherwunk/pygjs (PyGame in NodeWebkit/Browser).  I forked it so that I can perform a commit showing all my customizations

This library also integrates asherwunk/howler.js, as well as asherwunk/HTML5-JavaScript-Gamepad-Controller-Library, and nodebox/opentype.js

# What's Different

For fonts, I use opentype.js

For audio, I export howler.js

For gamepad support I export gamepad.js

I've made extensive modifications, particularly to Surface and SurfaceArray, I've also edited event.js to include animationFrame

To see all modifications, for now, check the commit history
